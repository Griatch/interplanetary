这是我制作一个完整的宇宙战斗棋盘游戏，我多年来一直在与朋友一起游玩。游戏快速且易于上手，它在太阳系内描绘了太空飞船间“逼真”的太空战斗。

This is a full space combat board game that I created and which I 
have been gradually refining over many years of playing with my friends. 
The gameplay is fast and easy to learn yet portrays "realistic" space combat using
believable space ships on the Inner solar system scale. 

星际所模拟的运动系统可能是最流畅的牛顿运动系统之一。你可以在二维的六边形网格地图上进行游玩，上手这款游戏是非常简单的。出于这个原因，它可能也可以很好地充当孩子们学习宇宙和引力的教育工具。

Interplanetary sports what is probably one of the most fluid Newtonian 
movement systems you can portray on a hex-grid in 2D, and it's really
quite easy to learn. For this reason it could probably work quite well 
also as an educational tool for kids learning about space and gravity. 

作战机制简单，武器真实。
每个回合都代表着飞船沿轨移动的真实天数，导弹在相当远的地方徘徊，而舰载武器则试图追踪着天空中无穷远的小点。

The combat mechanics are simple and model believable weapon systems. 
Each turn represents days of real time as ships move along their trajectories, 
missiles home in over vast distances and guns try to track that impossibly
small spot in the sky. 

星际只需直接在可打印的地图上绘图即可游玩，这使得它非常便携。游戏附带了游玩指南，但游戏辅助卡片也包含了游戏基本所需的一切——可以用来自定义你的船的舰载武器、助推器和各种组件们。

Interplanetary is played by drawing directly on the printed map, making it 
very portable. The game comes with a manual but the game-aid contains everything 
needed for play, including customizing your ship with weapons, boosters and various 
bonus systems.

## 内容 Contents
这个 Github 仓库包含二进制版本的游玩指南、游戏辅助卡片和太阳系地图。因为游戏中的每个玩家和飞船都需要一个游戏辅助卡片，所以游玩前应该打印它们。地图最好打印得尽可能大，可以打印到 A3 或 A4 纸上。除此以外，唯一需要的是标准六面骰子。

The repository contains binary versions of the manual, the game-aid and
the map. The map and game-aids are supposed to be printed as each player and ship in the game gets
one game-aid. The map is best printed as large as possible, it has A4 proportions 
but can be printed to at least A3 without any problems. The only other thing needed is a six-sided die. 

用于创建所有内容的源文件位于 src / 中。要编译英文原版的游玩指南，您需要 LaTeX，而游戏辅助卡片和地图是分别使用 Inkscape 和 GIMP 创建的。

Source files for creating everything is in src/. To compile the manual you need LaTeX whereas the gameaid is 
created in Inkscape and the map using GIMP.

星际的移动系统借鉴了GDW的长期绝版游戏 [Triplanetary]（http://www.sjgames.com/triplan/）。现在，该游戏的许可证属于 Steve Jackson Games 。除了运动的有关概念，星际不使用 Triplanetary 的其他资源。

The movement system of Interplanetary is borrowed from the long out-of-print game
[Triplanetary](http://www.sjgames.com/triplan/) by GDW. These days the license 
belongs to Steve Jackson Games. Apart from the concept of movement, Interplanetary
uses no other resources from Triplanetary.
