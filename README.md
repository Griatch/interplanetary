Interplanetary
==============

![Jupiter passage](src/img/passage.png) 

This is a full space combat board game that I created and which I 
have been having a lot of fun refining and playing with my friends. 
The gameplay is fast and easy to learn yet tries to portray realistic space combat using
believable space ships on the Inner solar system scale. 

Interplanetary sports what is probably one of the most fluid Newtonian 
movement systems you can portray on a hex-grid in 2D - and it's really
quite easy to get one's head around it. For this reason it could
probably work quite well also as an educational tool for kids learning
about space and gravity. 

Rules are fast and fun, with simple combat mechanics showing how space
combat might actually happen. Each turn represents days of real time as ships
move along their vectors and missiles home in over vast distances. 

Interplanetary is played by writing directly on the printed map.  
The game comes with a manual but the game-aid really contains everything 
needed for play, including customizing your ship with weapons, ship systems and reaction
mass. The only other thing needed is a six-sided die. 

## Contents


The repo contains binary versions of the manual, the game aid and
the map. It's recommended to print the game aid and fold it along the
lines in three to compactness. Each player and ship in the game gets
one game aid. The map is best printed as large as
possible, it has A4 proportions but can be printed at least to A3
without any problems.  

Source files sits in src/. To compile the manual you need LaTeX whereas the gameaid is 
created in Inkscape and the map using GIMP. 


## Credits

The movement system of Interplanetary is borrowed from the long out-of-print game
[Triplanetary](http://www.sjgames.com/triplan/) by GDW. These days the license 
belongs to Steve Jackson Games. Apart from the concept of movement, Interplanetary
uses no other resources from Triplanetary.
