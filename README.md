Interplanetary
==============

![Jupiter passage](src/img/passage.png) 

This is a full space combat board game. It plays
with realistic space ships on the Inner solar system scale. 

Interplanetary emulates space combat using what is probably the most realistic Newtonian 
movement system you can portray on a hex-grid in 2D - and it's really
quite easy to get one's head around it too. 

Rules are fast and fun, with simple combat mechanics realistically
showing space combat. Each turn represents days of real time as ships
move along their vectors and missiles home in over vast distances. 

Interplanetary is played by printing the map and the game aids and
writing directly on the printed map.  The game comes with a manual but
the game-aid contains everything needed for play, including the
outfitting of different ships with weapons, ship systems and reaction
mass. The only other thing needed is a six-sided die. 

## Contents


The repo contains binary versions of the manual, the game aid and
the map. It's recommended to print the game aid and fold it along the
lines in three to compactness. The map is best printed as large as
possible, it has A4 proportions but can be printed at least to A3
without any problems.  

Source files sits in src/. To compile the manual you need LaTeX whereas the gameaid is 
creted in Inkscape and the map using GIMP. 


## Credits

The movement system is borrowed from the long out-of-print game
*Triplanetary* (these days owned by Steve Jackson games). Apart 
from the concept of movement no other resources or game systems are used 
from that game.
